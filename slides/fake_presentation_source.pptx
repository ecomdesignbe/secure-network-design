Slide 1 – Project Introduction
Title: Secure Network Design
Content:

New office setup for a growing company

Full network redesign with a focus on security, scalability, and efficiency

Based on client constraints and best practices

Slide 2 – Project Objectives
Title: Project Goals
Bullet Points:

Design a segmented and scalable enterprise network

Implement centralized services (DNS, DHCP, iSCSI)

Introduce strong internal security (DMZ, ACLs, RADIUS)

Ensure cost-effectiveness and future expansion

Slide 3 – Client Requirements
Title: Client Requirements Overview
Content:

5 departments: Management, Study, Production, Support A & B

Required services: DNS, DHCP, iSCSI storage

Secure segmentation using VLANs

DMZ implementation (no traditional firewall)

Centralized authentication via RADIUS

GNS3 simulation + documentation + final presentation

Slide 4 – Network Design Summary
Title: Network Design Overview
Diagram: Topology overview (screenshot or simplified visual)
Key Highlights:

6 VLANs: 5 internal + 1 DMZ

Inter-VLAN routing and ACLs on Layer 3 device

All servers placed in a secured DMZ VLAN

iSCSI access restricted to Management only

Slide 5 – IP Addressing & VLANs
Title: VLAN & IP Planning
Table Snapshot:

VLAN	Department	Subnet	Reserved IPs
10	Management	192.168.10.0/24	.1 (gateway), .10 (iSCSI)
20	Study	192.168.20.0/24	.1 (gateway)
30	Production	192.168.30.0/24	.1 (gateway)
40	Support A	192.168.40.0/24	.1 (gateway)
50	Support B	192.168.50.0/24	.1 (gateway)
60	DMZ (Servers)	192.168.60.0/24	.10 DNS, .20 DHCP

Slide 6 – Security Strategy Overview
Title: Core Security Principles
Bullet Points:

VLAN segmentation to isolate departments

DMZ VLAN for exposed infrastructure

ACLs to strictly control inter-VLAN traffic

Static IPs for all critical assets

Future-proofing with centralized RADIUS

Slide 7 – DMZ Implementation
Title: DMZ Design & Purpose
Content:

VLAN 60 contains all core servers

Acts as buffer between user VLANs and infrastructure

Limited access via ACLs:

DNS/DHCP available to all

iSCSI available only to Management

Increases control & reduces attack surface

Slide 8 – Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Title: Access Control (ACLs)
Visual: Simple ACL flowchart or text logic
Key Rules:

All traffic denied by default

Allow DNS (UDP 53), DHCP, iSCSI as needed

No lateral access between user VLANs

Tested via ping/DNS resolution between VLANs

Slide 9 – RADIUS Authentication
Bullet Points:

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) provides centralized authentication for network devices

Configured on switches/routers for both console and VTY (SSH/Telnet) access

Ensures:

Secure admin login with username/password

Centralized control of credentials

Auditing of login attempts

Reduces risk from weak or local-only credentials

Slide 10 – Budget Summary
Title: Estimated Hardware Budget
Content:

Total estimated cost: €???

Emphasis on cost-effectiveness + scalability
