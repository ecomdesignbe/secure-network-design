## **Cost Optimization Tips**

- **Reuse Existing Equipment**: Reusing available servers or switches can significantly cut costs, especially for testing, early deployment, or non-critical services.
- **Consider Refurbished Hardware**: Mid-range servers and network devices are often available at 60–80% discounts in the refurbished market.
- **Key Considerations for Refurbished Equipment**:
  - Ensure firmware compatibility and vendor support.
  - Confirm warranty coverage.
  - Test all components in a lab environment prior to production deployment.

### **Refurbished Cost Estimate (Most Cost-Efficient Approach)**

By utilizing refurbished equipment from reputable sources (**Cisco Refresh**, certified resellers), you can potentially reduce the total setup cost from **€8,600** to approximately **€3,000**, without compromising on reliability—ideal for small to medium-sized businesses.
