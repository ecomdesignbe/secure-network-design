# üß© Project Summary: Secure Network Design

## ‚úÖ Goals of the Project

1. **Design a Secure and Modern Network**  
   Develop a cost-effective, secure, and efficient network for a client relocating to a new office.

2. **Simulate the Network Design**  
   Use **GNS3** to build and test the network design.

3. **Ensure Strong Security**  
   Prioritize and implement best security practices using **VLANs**, **ACLs**, and **centralized authentication** (e.g., RADIUS).

4. **Create Detailed Documentation**  
   Provide clear, structured documentation including:
   - Network layout
   - IP addressing tables
   - Device configurations
   - Security measures
   - Cost breakdown

5. **Demonstrate and Justify Design Choices**  
   Present and explain the network design to stakeholders, justifying technical and security decisions.

6. **Ensure Network Functionality and Scalability**  
   Ensure the network is functional, maintainable, and scalable for future growth.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints of the Project

1. **Time Constraint**  
   - Project deadline: **7 days**

2. **Simulation Tools**  
   - Use **GNS3** (preferred)  
   - **Packet Tracer** can be used with limitations

3. **Client Requirements**  

   **Must include:**
   - DNS server  
   - DHCP server  
   - DMZ concept via **VLANs** and **ACLs**  
   - iSCSI storage server  

   **Network Sectors:**
   - Management/Secretariat: 5 workstations  
   - Study: 8 workstations  
   - Production: 10 workstations  
   - Support: 2 sectors with 10 workstations each

4. **Security Simulation Limits**  
   - Firewall simulation limited in **Packet Tracer**  
   - Must implement alternative measures such as:  
     - VLAN segmentation  
     - ACLs  
     - Strong passwords  
     - Centralized authentication (e.g., RADIUS)

5. **Cost Awareness**  
   - Make **budget-conscious choices** in hardware and configuration based on available online pricing.

6. **Presentation Requirement**  
   - **10-minute group presentation**  
   - All team members must participate
